# Counter Function Web App

A simple yet visually engaging counter web application that allows users to increment, decrement, or reset a displayed number within a set range (0–1000). This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🔧 Features

- **Increment/Decrement**: Increase or decrease the number using arrow buttons.
- **Reset**: Reset the counter to 0 with one click.
- **Range Wrapping**: If the counter goes below 0, it wraps back to 1000. If it exceeds 1000, it resets to 0.
- **Retro Styling**: Custom design using a pixel-style font and layered background imagery for a nostalgic tech aesthetic.

## 💡 Purpose & Usefulness

This project reinforces foundational skills in:
- DOM manipulation via JavaScript
- Event handling (`click` events)
- Styling with Flexbox and CSS gradients
- HTML structure and layout
- User interaction design and responsive feedback

It serves as an excellent beginner project for those learning front-end development, offering hands-on practice in integrating structure (HTML), style (CSS), and logic (JavaScript).
